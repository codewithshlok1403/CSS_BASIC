# CSS_BASIC
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of web pages, including aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and overall design. It works alongside HTML to enhance the appearance of a website by providing styling rules. With CSS, you can control elements such as:

Colors: Set the background, text, and border colors.
Fonts: Define the font family, size, weight, and spacing of text.
Layouts: Use grids, flexboxes, and positioning to structure elements on the page.
Spacing: Manage margins, padding, and borders to control the layout of elements.
Transitions & Animations: Add interactive effects, like hover animations or smooth transitions.
